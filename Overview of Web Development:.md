Overview of Web Development:
        Browser -- Sends Request --> Google.com --sedns back response --> Browser
        This operation is based on unified protocol named http(HyperText Transfer Protocol) protocol -->> it defines a set rules which are unified so that application across the Internet know how to exchange data with each other and communicate each other.

        https protocol(HyperText Transfer protocol secure)- It is same as http, it also add encryption to our request so thet when a request goes from browser to the server, if there is a praying eye there, somebody that would like to see what kind of data is the  sending to the actual server is locked and when the response comes back is also encrypted and hence anybody who intercepts our request in the middle cannot actually understand what's going on.

        GET request
        POST request
        PUT request
        DELETE request
